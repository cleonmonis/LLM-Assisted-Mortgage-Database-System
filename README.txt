Harsh - implemented the ilab_script.py component and Postgres database connections, and helped with the SSH tunnel functionality between the local environment and iLab.
Cleon - created the database_llm.py program, brought together all project components, played with the LLM to get it to work, testing, and created the project demonstration video.
Sameel - created the schema.sql file, helped Cleon find queries for the LLM and tweak it
Saanvi - created the create_database.sql script with the sample data and helped fine tune SQL responses for LLM and helped created additional test queries.

The most challenging thing for us had to be figuring out what the errors that came up with a lot of the queries that we orginally selected. Our Project 1 database had some errors and some data that didn't get transferred and that it wouldn't come up or that the schema was not working properly. It took us a long time to get a schema that was working, that would answer the questions we were asking and also wouldn't cause any errors. 

What we found interesting was just using the local llm and messing around with it and how it would give different answers sometimes based on the size of the context window that you gave it and even with the instructions it would respond in separate ways. Also just doing the tunnel to the ilab database worked really well and our coordination with the online llm Claude and the local llm and our code was a great learning experience.

Yes we implemented the extra credit part as well.
